<center><h1>Haphazard C++ Style Guide</h1></center>
    
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p class="SectionHeader">Motivation</p>
Having a consistent style means:
<ul>
<li>Less mental energy is spent on parsing style differences between files.
<li>Code is likely to be easier to understand than it might otherwise be.
<li>It’s easier to work on files even when you didn’t initially write them.
</ul>
The purpose of a style guide is not to impose arbitrary restrictions on code (though some style decisions are arbitrary), but to keep things as clear and consistent as possible.
<p></p>
Whenever there’s any confusion or doubt about what exactly to do, ask yourself what another programmer coming to look at your file would need to make everything clear, understandable, and as hassle-free for them as possible.
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p class="SectionHeader">Spacing</p>
Indentation should be done with tabs, but any spacing once at the proper indentation level should use spaces:
<pre class="sourcecode"><code>
int main()
{
	int variables = 0;
	int      that = 1;
	int      need = 2;
	int    lining = 3;
	int        up = 4;
	
	if (that != need)
	{
		int moreIndentedCode = 5;
	}
	
	return 0;
}
</code></pre>
Binary operators should always have spaces around them:
<pre class="sourcecode"><code>
// Good usage.
int good = (1 + 2) * 14;

// Bad usage
int bad=(1+2)*14;
</code></pre>
Unary operators should never have spaces after them:
<pre class="sourcecode"><code>
// Good usage.
int good = -5;

// Bad usage
int bad = - 5;
</code></pre>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p class="SectionHeader">Naming</p>
Names should strike a balance between not taking up too much space and clearly indicating what that name represents, with an emphasis towards the latter. The more localized to a scope a name is, the shorter it can be.

Variables should be written in lowerCamelCase:
<pre class="sourcecode"><code>
// This is correct:
int someGoodVariable;

// These should be avoided:
int SomeBadVariable;
int another_bad_variable;
</code></pre>
Function names should also be written in lowerCamelCase:
<pre class="sourcecode"><code>
// Correct.
float secondsToHours(int time);

// Incorrect
float SecondsToHours(int seconds);
float seconds_to_hours(int seconds);
</code></pre>
Constants should be in ALL_CAPS:
<pre class="sourcecode"><code>
// Correct.
const int GOOD_CONSTANT = 0;

// Incorrect
const int badConstant = 1;
const int ANOTHERBADCONSTANT = 2;
</code></pre>
Private member variables should begin with "m_":
<pre class="sourcecode"><code>
class ExampleClass
{
public:
    bool publicVariable;

private:
    int m_somePrivateMemberVariable;
    float m_shorterName;
}
</code></pre>
    
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p class="SectionHeader">Comments</p>
Comments are (generally) good.

<h2>When to Comment</h2>
In general, there are two places where comments should be used:
<ul>
    <li> Comments can serve as “landmarks” of sorts in the code, telling the reader what the next handful of lines will be doing: </li>
</ul>
<pre class="sourcecode"><code>
// Check each enemy and delete it if it's dead.
for (int i = 0; i < objectCount; ++i)
{
  if (objectArr[i]->health <= 0)
  {
    delete objectArr[i];
    objectArr[i] = nullptr;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
    <li> Comments can explain <i>why</i> something is being done the way it is. </li>
</ul>
<pre class="sourcecode"><code>                    
// Sprite sizes not divisible by 4 mess up the lighting buffer.
// Return early if we run into any.
if (sprite->width % 4 != 0 || sprite->height % 4 != 0)
{
  return;
}
</code></pre>
Obviously, put comments wherever you think they’re necessary, but the majority of comments should fit into one of the categories above.

<h2>When NOT to Comment</h2>
Comments where there shouldn’t be any just clutter things up. Let the code speak for itself where it can.

<h2>Doxygen</h2>
Haha no.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p class="SectionHeader">General Formatting</p>
Writing in C++ means there are a lot of little style decisions that need to be made. These are less philosophical than, say, commenting, but they need to be said. Here’s a bunch of those.

<h2>Brackets</h2>
Brackets always go on their own line:
<pre class="sourcecode"><code>
// Do this
if (conditional)
{
  // CODE
}
 
// Not this
if (conditional){
  // CODE
}
</code></pre>
This is intended to line up the brackets so they can be more easily matched with one another.

<h2>File Header Comments</h2>
Every file should have a header comment. Like so:
<pre class="sourcecode"><code>   
/*******************************************************
FILE: <file>.cpp
 
PRIMARY AUTHOR: <author>
 
PROJECT: <project_name>
 
Copyright 2017 DigiPen (USA) Corporation.
*******************************************************/
</code></pre>
Personally I think file header comments aren’t very good, but DigiPen requires this info so we get to put it there.

<h2>Function Header Comments</h2>
Function header comments are not required, but you are <i>highly</i> encouraged to put at least a short comment above each function describing its purpose.
<p></p>
Also remember to use comments to indicate usage, return values, etc. when they're not immediately obvious.
