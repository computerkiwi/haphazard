Hey there. This is a git repository!
We'll be using git as our version control for this project, so it's a good idea to learn it.

In theory git can be used pretty much like SVN. Just us git pull instead of SVN update and git push instead of SVN commit.
That being said, git has some benefits over SVN if you use it to its fullest. Mostly branching! Branch early and branch often.

This is my favorite tutorial for figuring out git conceptually:

As of right now (4/24/2017) I'm just setting up folder structures and stuff to play around in. Go do some stuff idk.
